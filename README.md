This is a simple experiment to make a small application, upload it to github, dockerhub and finish it off by running a container
in Docker using this application.
The main attraction is the main.py file. Inside it you'll find a simple multiplication list.
The next thing you'll find is a dockerfile. There you'll find the configuration for the future pod that will run this code.
